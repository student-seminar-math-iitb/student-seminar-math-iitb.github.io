title: Topics in Combinatorics
speaker: Sohan Sawant
abstract: The involution principle ( generalized idea of bijection ) and it's various applications. Then I'll take most elegant theorem, Lemma of Gessel-Viennot, one that reveals via involutions an astounding connection between lattice paths and determinants. 
And discuss a number it's interesting applications - 
1) proving some theorems on determinants â€œat a glance" purely combinatorially.
2) an unexpected and beautiful characterization of the Catalan numbers.
3) enumeration of plane partitions.
4) most beautiful application - number of spanning trees in graph comes as determinant of a certain matrix.
