title: Lagrange's Four Square Theorem
speaker: Poornima B
abstract: Most problems in Number theory are easy to state. But unlike most, Langrange's four square is easy to prove. It states that every natural number is a sum of four squares. In the talk, we will sketch the proof and then look at ways in which we can generalize the result. This talk will be made accessible to all (even freshmen) by the speaker.
